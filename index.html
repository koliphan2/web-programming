        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying at BYU, aiming for a major in illustration, with minors in computer science and psychology.</p>
        <p>My professional aim is to be an animator, and make full-length feature films with an animation company, though gamework would be enjoyable for me to learn as well.</p>
        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Image Editor:
                <p style="margin-left: 3%">A simple image editor that can take any image, and invert it, greyscale it, or emboss it</p>
            </li>
            <li>Evil Hangman Game:
                <p style="margin-left: 3%">An online game of hangman, where players will play against the computer. The 'evil' part of the program is the fact that the word was not chosen before hand, but instead, based around the guesses, the computer will continuously switch words that still match the eliminated or already guessed letters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Simple Spell-Checker:
                <p style="margin-left: 3%">This program will take in any word, and, based around an impmorted dictionary, will either say it is a valid word, or correct the spelling to closest and most common word if possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Background code for a database, users, and accounts:
                <p style="margin-left: 3%">This is the completed backend code for a SQL database of users and information for an app. The client front end is still underdevelopment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Experience:</h2>
        <p>I have had no computer science working experience.</p>
